Homework 1 in ADM

- scripts.py - contains solutions for all problems. The file is organized into sections (e.g., Introduction, Data Types, Strings) marked by double hash symbols (##). Within each section, individual exercises are denoted by single hash symbols (#). Single hash symbols are also used for comments throughout the file :( 
- stamps.pdf - contains my trials and results on Hackerranck.
